## Full Stack Project Using MERN

Welcome to our Food Delivery Website built using the MERN stack! This full-stack project allows users to browse through a diverse menu, select their desired items, and place orders conveniently. Leveraging MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, we have created a seamless and responsive application for food enthusiasts.
The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript-based technology stack used for building modern web applications. It is an acronym that stands for:
MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. MongoDB is highly scalable and widely used for its ease of integration with JavaScript-based applications.
Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs by providing a robust set of features and middleware.
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js enables developers to create interactive, component-based UIs efficiently. It is renowned for its virtual DOM (Document Object Model) and declarative approach to building UIs.
Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to build full-stack applications entirely in JavaScript.

# How It Works:
Browse Menu: Users can explore our extensive menu featuring a variety of delicious food items, including appetizers, main courses, desserts, and beverages.
Add to Cart: Upon finding their desired items, users can click on the "Add" button to add them to their cart. The website dynamically updates the cart summary, displaying the total order amount and selected items.
Your Cart: Users can review the items in their cart, make modifications if needed, and proceed to checkout when ready to place the order.
Checkout: At checkout, users provide necessary details such as delivery address, contact information, and payment preferences. Upon successful order placement, users receive a unique order number for reference.
Order Confirmation: Users receive a confirmation message along with an order summary, including the total amount and order number. Our backend system processes the order details and stores them in the MongoDB database for future reference.
