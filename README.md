## Full Stack Project Using MERN

The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript-based technology stack used for building modern web applications. It is an acronym that stands for:
MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. MongoDB is highly scalable and widely used for its ease of integration with JavaScript-based applications.
Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs by providing a robust set of features and middleware.
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js enables developers to create interactive, component-based UIs efficiently. It is renowned for its virtual DOM (Document Object Model) and declarative approach to building UIs.
Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to build full-stack applications entirely in JavaScript.

In this project,i have developed a Front-end Application using React JS.
I have developed a food delivery site using MONGODB, EXPRESSJS, REACTJS, NODEJS.I have developed a complete full stack project.In my site,a user can choose the item from a large menu and order the items as per his/her convenience.The number of orders placed is stored in my mongodb database.I have used MONGODB for storing my data.I have used expressja nd nodejs as the middleware.

### Front-End Application

In this sample menu is visible.If we click on add,it will get added in the YourCart and you can easily order from the cart.

If the order is placed then the order no is generated.The amount and the quantity is stored in the database.This is done with the help of middleware.
